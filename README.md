# DSC-TECHSTACK

TechStack topics for computational (and data) scientists.  The list of topics (see topics folder) is incomplete.  The course was inspired by (i) a summer course run by [Dr. Ed Overman at Ohio State University](https://math.osu.edu/people/overman.2) and (ii) [MIT - The Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu).




## Course description

This course facilitates the development of proficiency with computational and data science tools. Critical elements of the computing ecosystem that could make workflows smoother and easier are covered. These topics include but are not limited to the command line, the use of text editors, and version control systems. Mastering such tools enables one to become more efficient at problem-solving and provides unique knowledge and skills.



## Learning Outcomes
After this course, students will be able to:

* navigate the file directory from the command line;
* add, remove, and rename files and directories at the CLI;
* clone a repository; add, commit, and push files to repository; create a pull request;
* typeset mathematics;
* develop a professional profile;
* create, edit, and save text files;
* obtain data from the website via web scraping;
* visualize and manipulate geometrical objects;
* perform basic data wrangling using R;
* consider data ethics issues;
* differentiate and integrate functions unable to do by hand; 
* examine computer security and privacy issues.
