# LinkedIn Profile

Quick facts:

## Profile Picture.

First, you need a profile picture.  The picture should be:

* Close-up
* Neutral background
* Look into the camera
* Smile
* Dress appropriately (business attire), no sunglasses

Avoid on LinkedIn
* Sunglasses
* No alcohol
* Smoking
* Hiking
* In the car

These may be good for Instagram.

	- Likeability, influence, and competence


## Update Background Picture (change default background)




## Headline

Update your headline to "sell" yourself.  By default, LinkedIn uses your Title. 
Headline - text below your name (advertise yourself)
	- The default is job title
	- Job Title + company name + keywords + Zing factor (conversation starter)

 

```
Job Title + Company Name + Keywords + Zing Factor
```

Use keywords that search engines would use to find you.  The zing factor could be a conversation started.  "Helping people reach their potential".



## Summary

Add links.  Links can include:

* videos
* website
* blog
* slideshare
* YouTube

 
Here's how:

Under summary, in the ABOUT section, click the pencil icon and it is self-explanatory.  



## 5 Tips

1. Pick a professional photo and background.  Go to removebg.com.  Remove the background.  
Then, go to canva.com (with a transparent background) and use a 1600 x 1600 resolution.  

For background, search and select.  




2. Complement resume with an about section (summary section).   Add a quote, example:
Product marketer with 6+ years in the B2B market in China.  
"I explain complex products in ways business owners understand."



3. Showcase real projects in the "Featured" section.  




4. Highlight achievement in the "Experience" Section.  Expand on key achievements found in your resume.  Use a keyword cloud tag to get a list of keywords to sprinkle into the profile. 




5. Get your own custom LinkedIn URL.

Edit your profile, get your LinkedIn URL.
