# Markdown Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, created in 2004 by John Gruber with [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) .  Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.




## Headers

Headers are signified by the hashtag, `#`.  The heading level is directly connected to the number of hashtags.  H1 uses one, H2 two, etc.  Here are H1, H2, H3, and H6 headers.

# Heading H1
## Heading H2
### Heading H3
###### Heading H6






## Emphasis
Emphasis text with italics, bold face, and strikethrough.  

### Italics

To italize wrap the text in asterisk or underscores, i.e., `_italics_`.  In particular
This *word* or *group of words* is italized by the asterisk.  _This will also be italic_



### Bold
 Use __double__ asterisk __or__ underscores, i.e., `**bold**` or `__bold__`.  Look at the code and you will see **this is bold**, as is __this__. 



_It is also possible to  **combine** italics and boldface_.



### Strikethrough
Double tilde (`~~strike this~~`) are used to strikethrough text.  For example, ~~Is our children learning?~~




## Lists


### Unordered

Bullet lists use the asterisk to denote list items.   Indentation creates subitems.  In particular, 

```

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

```

produces the list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
	* Item 2a
	* Item 2b


### Ordered

Ordered lists (and sublists) use digits (1,2,3,...) and indentation.  The following code produces the ordered list.

The code, 
```
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
  1. Item 3a
  1. Item 3b
```

yields the ordered list:

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
	1. Item 3a
	1. Item 3b



## Task lists

```

-  [x] Eat 
-  [ ] Study
-  [ ] Sleep

```
renders as:

-  [x] Eat 
-  [ ] Study
-  [ ] Sleep




## Images

Images are displayed starting with the exclaimation point followed by square brackets containing the alt text and path to image in parenthesis, i.e., `![alt text](image.jpg)`.

![Alt text in square brackets](./images/filesystem.png)





## URL hyperlinks

Square brackets enclose the text to be hyperlinked with the URL following in parenthesis. Specifically, `[Click here](https://www.website.com)`.  For example, tired of being tracked on the web?  [Search with DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/).





## Blockquotes

> When its all said and done, more is said than done. --  Lou Holtz







## Tables

| Left columns  | Right columns |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Taco		    | $1.99			|
| Pizza         | $12.50        |
| Hot Dog       | $2.25         |





## Blocks of code
Code blocks begin (and end) with three slash quotes.  The code is inserted between.

```{python}
msg  = 'Hello world'
for i in range(10):
	print(msg)
```


## Inline code
Code can be placed in a sentence such as `foo.bar` by enclosing the text by keyboard character '96' (to the left of '1' key).  


## Horizontal Line (Break)

Use three (or more) dashes to make a horizontal line.

### Icons

There are many icons that can be displayed.  Here are a few  examples, a flower, :white_flower: generated by `:white_flower:` and fire, :fire: by `:fire:`.  



### Escaping characters
To escape any markdown-sensitive character, place a backslash ( \\ ) before the character. For example, `\*escape\*` the astricks character.  If you want a backslash character, escape the backslash with double backslash ( \\\\ ).
