* Introduce students to VS Code, a free and open source code editor developed by Microsoft.

* Discuss the features of VS Code, including its support for various programming languages, integrated terminal, and extensions marketplace.

* Walk students through the process of downloading and installing VS Code.


## Lesson 2: Using VS Code

* Introduce students to the basic functionality of VS Code, including creating and opening files, navigating the user interface, and using the integrated terminal.

* Walk students through some basic coding tasks using VS Code, such as writing and executing a simple "Hello World" program in Python.


## Lesson 3: Customizing VS Code

* Introduce students to the concept of extensions in VS Code and the extensions marketplace.

* Demonstrate how to install and use popular extensions, such as the Python extension for VS Code or the GitLens extension for managing Git repositories.

* Walk students through customizing their VS Code settings and keybindings to match their preferences.


## Lesson 4: Collaboration and Debugging in VS Code

* Introduce students to the built-in collaboration and debugging features of VS Code.

* Walk students through using the Live Share extension to collaborate on code in real-time with others.

* Demonstrate how to use the built-in debugging tools in VS Code to diagnose and fix issues in code.


## Lesson 5: Advanced Topics in VS Code

* Introduce students to some advanced topics in VS Code, such as using the integrated Git client or configuring workspace settings.

* Demonstrate how to use the VS Code command palette to access advanced features and commands.

* Encourage students to continue exploring VS Code and experimenting with different extensions and customizations.




### Assignment Exercises

In this assignment, you will become familiar with the basic features of Visual Studio Code and learn how to use it to write and execute simple code.

By completing this assignment, you will have gained experience in using basic features of VS Code, executing code, and customizing the settings to your preferences. You will also have the opportunity to share your work with others and reflect on your learning experience.


###### Task 1: Install Visual Studio Code

If you have not already done so, download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website.


###### Task 2: Create and Open a File

* Open Visual Studio Code.

* Create a new file by clicking on the "New File" button in the Explorer panel on the left side of the window.

* Save the file with a meaningful name and appropriate file extension (e.g. "hello_world.py" for a Python file).


###### Task 3: Write and Execute Code

* Write a simple "Hello World" program in the language of your choice (e.g. print("Hello, World!") in Python).

* Save the file.

* Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by clicking on "Terminal" in the top menu and selecting "New Terminal".

* Navigate to the directory where your file is saved using the cd command.

* Execute your code using the appropriate command for your programming language (e.g. python hello_world.py for Python).

###### Task 4: Customize VS Code

* Explore the VS Code settings by clicking on "Preferences: Open User Settings" in the Command Palette (accessible with Ctrl + Shift + P).

* Modify at least one setting to customize your VS Code experience (e.g. changing the font size, enabling word wrap, or configuring a keyboard shortcut).

###### Task 5: Share Your Work

* Take a screenshot of your code in Visual Studio Code and the output in the integrated terminal.

* Post your screenshot to the class discussion forum and share your thoughts on your experience with VS Code so far.
