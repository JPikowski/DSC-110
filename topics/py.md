# Introduction to Python



This lesson plan covers the basics of Python programming, including installing Python, working with data types and variables, using operators and expressions, controlling flow, defining functions, working with lists and dictionaries, input and output, and object-oriented programming (optional). By the end of this lesson plan, students will have a solid foundation in Python programming and be able to create their own Python programs.


## Lesson 1: Installing Python


Verify that Python has been installed correctly using the python --version command.


## Lesson 2: Basic Data Types and Variables
Introduce data types (integer, float, string, and Boolean).
Declare and assign variables in Python.
Print variables to the console using the `print()` function.


## Lesson 3: Operators and Expressions
Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %).
Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
Logical operators (and, or, not).
Combine operators and variables to create expressions.


## Lesson 4: Control Flow
Explain conditional statements (if, elif, else) and how they are used in Python.
Teach loops (for, while) and how they are used to execute code repeatedly.
Demonstrate how to use break and continue statements in loops.


## Lesson 5: Functions
Teach how to define and call functions in Python.
Explain parameters and arguments in functions.
Show how to return values from functions.


## Lesson 6: Lists and Dictionaries
Lists and dictionaries and their differences.
Create and manipulate lists and dictionaries in Python.
Use list comprehension to create new lists.


## Lesson 7: Input and Output
Read and write files in Python.


## Lesson 8: Object-Oriented Programming (Optional)
Classes and objects.
Define and use classes in Python.


## Lesson 9: Final Project
Create a program that solves a specific problem.
