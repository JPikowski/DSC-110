# DSC 110 - Survey of Software Tools

TechStack topics for computational (and data) scientists.  The list of topics (see topics folder) is incomplete.  The course was inspired by (i) a summer course run by [Dr. Ed Overman at Ohio State University](https://math.osu.edu/people/overman.2) and (ii) [MIT - The Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu). Edited from [dsc-techstack](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/dsc-techstack) by James Quinlan, Ph.D.


## Course description

This course facilitates the development of proficiency with the tools of computational and data science. Critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make studentsâ€™ lives significantly easier are covered. These topics include but are not limited to the command-line, the use of text editors, and version control systems. Students will spend hundreds of hours using these tools throughout their education (and possibly thousands over their careers). Mastering such tools enables students to be more efficient at the problem-solving process and provides unique knowledge and skills.


## Learning Outcomes
After successful completion of this course, the student will:

1. demonstrate benefits of virtual machines
2. navigate directories using the command line and automate common computer tasks
3. typeset basic mathematical notation
4. use Git: initialize, clone, commit, push
5. create a professional LinkedIn profile
6. consider data ethics issues
7. examine computer security and privacy issues
